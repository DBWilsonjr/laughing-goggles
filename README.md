CPT 185 Final Project <br />
 <br />
Final Notes is the place for the comprehensive breakdown. This is just the todo list. <br />
 <br />
After testing it again on my desktop, it appears I have broken the game completely somewhere so it doesn't play to the end. That will probably be a few updates before it get completely fixed since the core parts are being rewritten anyway. <br />
 <br />
Current Task: <b>Integrate Character Creation forms</b>. Using two just needlessly complicates a simply process and passes information across too many forms. <br />
 <br />
Task List: <br />
1) Integrate Main Game and Power-up forms <br />
2) Rewrite combat core <br />
?) Rewrite enemy spawn to better use the enemy class <br />
?) Double-Check unlock conditions <br />
?) Revamp data management for classes, enemies, and abilities <br />
?) Data Entry <br />
?) Add the rest of the intended classes and abilities <br />
?) Add remaining unlocks and challenges <br />
