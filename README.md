CPT 185 Final Project <br />
 <br />
Final Notes is the place for the comprehensive breakdown. This is just the todo list. <br />
 <br />
After testing it again on my desktop, it appears I have broken the game completely somewhere so it doesn't play to the end. That will probably be a few updates before it get completely fixed since the core parts are being rewritten anyway. <br />
 <br />
<br /> 
Current Task: <b>Integrate Main Game and Power-up forms</b> - Again wasting two forms to do what should be done in one. Layout was the big issue that prompted this mess in the first place, but that's no excuse.<br />
<br />
Completed Tasks:
1) Integrate Character Creation forms - Simple merge of two forms. Layout is decent but definitely can be improved. Also fixed a crash on clearing inputs that I didn't catch any other time I tested this thing. Pretty sure I didn't break anything else. Left the Preview form in, just in case.<br />
<br />
Task List: <br />
1) Rewrite combat core <br />
?) Rewrite enemy spawn to better use the enemy class <br />
?) Double-Check unlock conditions <br />
?) Revamp data management for classes, enemies, and abilities <br />
?) Data Entry <br />
?) Add the rest of the intended classes and abilities <br />
?) Add remaining unlocks and challenges <br />
