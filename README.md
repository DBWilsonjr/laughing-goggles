CPT 185 Final Project <br />
 <br />
Final Notes is the place for the comprehensive breakdown. This is just the todo list. <br />
 <br />
After testing it again on my desktop, it appears I have broken the game completely somewhere so it doesn't play to the end. That will probably be a few updates before it get completely fixed since the core parts are being rewritten anyway. <br />
 <br />
<br /> 
Current Task: <b>Re-write combat core</b> - This is either going to be exactly as easy as I think it will or give me a headache that will breka my very spirit. The broad answer to the mess I've written is just going to be breaking up things in methods and assigning them to the appropriate button. I can't imagine it won't be that simple, but having seen my coding in this thing I'm sure there's a surprise somewhere.<br />
<br />
Completed Tasks:<br />
1) Integrate Character Creation forms - Simple merge of two forms. Layout is decent but definitely can be improved. Also fixed a crash on clearing inputs that I didn't catch any other time I tested this thing. Pretty sure I didn't break anything else. Left the Preview form in, just in case.<br />
2) MainGame/Power-up integration - Didn't go as planned. For how I want things to work, having two forms is actually best. Made the powering-up actually work for all stats now.<br />
3) <b>MainGame clean-up</b><br />
3a) Fixed the game not playing completely through<br />
3b) Fixed certain informational bits not updating properly<br />
3c) Added color-coding for enemies<br />
3d) Commented on some variable choices I made previously for easier parsing at a glance and possibly for moving later<br />
<br />
